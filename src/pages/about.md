## Hey, I am Pankaj

I'm a final year undergraduate at [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/), graduating with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I'll be joining [InMobi](https://www.inmobi.com/) as an SDE-1 soon, where I'm excited to build scalable systems and work on challenging problems in ad-tech.

## What I Do

I love building interesting systems and projects that solve real problems. My work spans across:

### Systems & Distributed Computing

- Built privacy-preserving protocols for **Tango-Sum** and **DORAM** that achieved **35% performance improvements** with **3.08x updates** and **23.5x queries** improvement for million-node segment trees
- Optimized secret-sharing algorithms for **DPRAM** accesses to enable faster queries on encrypted data

### AI & Machine Learning

- Developed **confidence calibration** methods for Telugu Handwriting Recognition achieving **5.51% CER** improvement using CRNN + BiLSTM + CTC architectures
- Built conversational AI interfaces with **ASR**, **in-house LLMs**, and **TTS** components using **WebSockets** for real-time communication

### Full-Stack Development

- Architected and built a **campus ride-sharing platform** with **React.js** frontend and **Express.js** backend, enabling coordination for **500+ journeys** with **real-time chat using WebSockets**
- Created a **Flask app** for HWR with character-level visualization supporting **multi-language estimation** and **aggregation methods**
- Built a **Puppeteer** automation to measure **SSE streaming times** across different chatbot providers

## Academic Excellence

- Awarded **Academic Excellence Award** (three times) for being in the **Top 10%** at IIT Kanpur with a **CGPA of 9.1/10**
- Secured **All India Rank 488** in **JEE Mains 2022** among **1.1 million applicants**
- Achieved a rank of **80** in **TS EAMCET** among **1.7 lac applicants**

## Research & Contributions

I've contributed to research in privacy-preserving algorithms, ML model confidence calibration, and distributed systems. My work has been recognized through:

- Full-term Intern at [Kruti AI](https://www.kruti.ai/) - contributed to pre-placement offer
- Research internships under Prof. Adithya Vadapalli and Prof. Sujaya Datta at IIT Kanpur

## Beyond Code

When I'm not building systems or exploring new tech:

- I'm passionate about **cooking vegetarian food** and experimenting with new recipes
- I share my technical learnings through blogs and **engineering videos**
- I enjoy diving deep into **databases, distributed systems, and algorithms**

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to discuss interesting technical problems, collaborate on projects, or just chat about systems, ML, or great vegetarian food!
